# GiTrack

Project manager and developer communication is very important in executing a project. Good communication between these two enables better estimation of time and amount of work done. Various communication and project management tools exist to keep track of the amount of work done - e.g. Github Projects, Trello, Scrummate, and Jira. However, these tools do not have an integrated way of viewing exactly what the current progress of a task is. 

Checking the current commits in a feature branch lets the developers know the current state of the code base. However, this information is not easily digestible by the project managers that do not have technical backgrounds. 

Gitrack makes it easier for both. A web application serves as the task board for the project managers and developers. This contains cards for every feature that needs to be built. For every commit on a specific feature branch, a resulting card on a board gets updated. This is done by attaching a hook for every commit. For example, a commit on the feature/git-hook branch will update the git-hook card in the accompanying web application.
